The Merlion Code

    In a campaign to celebrate Singapore's 60th birthday, as well as shed light on the lesser-talked about national monuments and historical locations, we've 
    created the Merlion Code, a trivia detective game designed to test people's knowledge on such locations. The game follows you, a detective, tasked with retrieving
    the Merlion, stolen by the infamous international thief Vanda Noir. She has broken the Merlion into different pieces and scattered them around Singapore. You've gathered
    intel that she's hidden them at different historical locations. It is your job now to scout these locations, solve her questions and bring back the Merlion!

Design Process

    To create The Merlion Code, we focused on user engagement and interactive storytelling. We developed wireframes, mockups, and gameplay diagrams to structure 
    the experience. The game was designed iteratively, incorporating feedback and refining the mechanics to ensure a balance between educational content and 
    entertainment.
